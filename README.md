# WaitLess

WaitLess is an Android App to manage the operations of Restaurant.

It started as a part of College project and but didn't stop there.

The basic idea of WaitLess is to digitalise the processes in a Restaurant. Viewing menu, creating a cart and ordering food right from the app as we do for ordering food delivery online. This results in reduced manpower and stationery requirements for the restaurants.

The app has following features: 
- Cuisine wise Menu
- Table Booking
- QR Code on each table in restaurant so that people on one table can share cart
- Ordering from the App itself, only after joining a table by scanning QR
- Small games to play while food is being prepared
- Bill splitting between people on same table based on orders by individuals and 
- Digital Payment options like Debit Card, Credit Card, Paytm Wallet and UPI from the app itself

The admin side of the App allows admin
- To confirm Table Reservation Requests or ask for revised table reservation details based on availability
- The admin gets the order with table number and all other details when the order is placed by user
- The admin needs to end a table session when asked by user, this leads to the Bill generation and is displayed to both user and admin
- The user can choose to pay digitally through the app or in cash
- Post Payment, the order details, time of order, dishes ordered, bill are added to "My Past Orders" section on the user side
- And necessary details are preserved on the admin side as well

I feel very proud to have thought of this idea long back. The online food delivery giant Zomato had been planning to adopt this exact same model to maintain contactless experience in dining as demanded by the current COVID-19 crisis.
